# create a time base using 'np.linspace' command
# - linspace syntax: (start, end, number_of_points)
t = np.linspace(0, T_total-dt, fs*T_total)

# is this the best way to make a time vector?
# I prefer   t = np.arange(0,T_total,dt)
# as it's easier to remember and
# makes more semantic sense with the underlying data structure:
# every tick is dt in length, from 0, up to but not including T_total.
# np.diff(t)[0] = dt and max(t) = t[-1] = T-total-dt like before
